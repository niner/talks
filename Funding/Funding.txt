Last year ribasushi started a fund raiser for DBIx::Class maintenance
On that occasion I went to our management and asked for a little budget to spend on advancing the free software our business is based on.
And something extraordinary happened.
I got it.

The fund raiser did not succeed but I still have this budget.
So now the Enlightened Perl Organisation gets 500 Euros each month.

Now as a homework exercise, I want each and every one of you to when you get home, go to your managers and ask for a budget.
Most will not be successful.
But you will never get anything.
Unless you ask.
