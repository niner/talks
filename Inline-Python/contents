    Embedding Python
    What would I use this for?
    CPAN growing, but still not complete ->

_use_cases.txt
    Python used for desktop stuff

    How does this look like?

16-first_example.pl
    use Inline
    Python code as string
    gets executed on the spot

    cool, but not very useful / could run external Python

-mixing.pl
    Functions in the __main__ namespace get imported
    Can be called like Perl subs
    Return values useful!

-parameters.pl
    Parameters work / data types get converted

    Inline code vs. libraries

13-libraries.pl

    os = operating system

    Returns list, context aware!

-arrayref.pl

-import.pl

-browser.pl
    Python desktop stuff
    webbrowser: control a user's default browser
    Use Python objects!
    Call methods

-class.pl
    Instantiate Python classes directly
    new == __init__

    All pretty cool, but all polluting the main namespace
    => lower level interface

-low-level.pl
    now useing Inline::Python instead of Inline interface

05-pyqt4.pl

-conclusion.txt
    Labeled BETA -> need more real world testing, maybe missing features
